# GibbsTopicModels
Gibbs sampling algorithms for several topic models, such as LDA, AT, and coAT. 

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Description
Topic model is family of generative probabilistic models for discovering the main themes from a collection of documents. For more elaborate and detailed surveys, we refer the readers to [1]. Examples of topic models include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2][3][4], Author-Topic (AT) model [5][6][7], and co-Author-Topic (coAT) model [8], and many others. 

The inference for topic models usually cannot be done exactly. A variety of approximate inference algorithms have appeared in recent years, such as stochastic variational inference, mean-field variational methods, expectation propagation, and Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling (MCMC). In this toolbox, Gibbs sampling, a special case of MCMC, is utilized, since it provides a simple method for obtaining parameter estimates under Dirichlet priors and allows combination of estimates from several local maxima of the posterior distribution.
